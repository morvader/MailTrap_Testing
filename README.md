Running the server:
* During development, we use both npm run watch-ts (recompiles application on source changes) and npm run watch-node (restarts application on recompilation)
  * One terminal: **npm run watch-ts**
  * Another terminal: **npm run watch-node**
* npm run build-ts only compiles the application
* npm run serve (npm run start) only starts the application
